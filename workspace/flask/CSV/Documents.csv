0,Bayesian Models and Decision Algorithms for Complex Early Phase Clinical Trials,"An early phase clinical trial is the first step in evaluating the effects inhumans of a potential new anti-disease agent or combination of agents. Usuallycalled ""phase I"" or ""phase I/II"" trials, these experiments typically have thenominal scientific goal of determining an acceptable dose, most often based onadverse event probabilities. This arose from a tradition of phase I trials toevaluate cytotoxic agents for treating cancer, although some methods may beapplied in other medical settings, such as treatment of stroke or immunologicaldiseases. Most modern statistical designs for early phase trials includemodel-based, outcome-adaptive decision rules that choose doses for successivepatient cohorts based on data from previous patients in the trial. Such designshave seen limited use in clinical practice, however, due to their complexity,the requirement of intensive, computer-based data monitoring, and the medicalcommunity's resistance to change. Still, many actual applications ofmodel-based outcome-adaptive designs have been remarkably successful in termsof both patient benefit and scientific outcome. In this paper I will reviewseveral Bayesian early phase trial designs that were tailored to accommodatespecific complexities of the treatment regime and patient outcomes inparticular clinical settings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.6494v1,Peter F.

1,Deep Historical Borrowing Framework to Prospectively and Simultaneously Synthesize Control Information in Confirmatory Clinical Trials with Multiple Endpoints,"In current clinical trial development, historical information is receivingmore attention as it provides utility beyond sample size calculation.Meta-analytic-predictive (MAP) priors and robust MAP priors have been proposedfor prospectively borrowing historical data on a single endpoint. Tosimultaneously synthesize control information from multiple endpoints inconfirmatory clinical trials, we propose to approximate posterior probabilitiesfrom a Bayesian hierarchical model and estimate critical values by deeplearning to construct pre-specified strategies for hypothesis testing. Thisfeature is important to ensure study integrity by establishing prospectivedecision functions before the trial conduct. Simulations are performed to showthat our method properly controls family-wise error rate (FWER) and preservespower as compared with a typical practice of choosing constant critical valuesgiven a subset of null space. Satisfactory performance under prior-dataconflict is also demonstrated. We further illustrate our method using a casestudy in Immunology.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12774v2,"Tianyu Zhan,Yiwang Zhou,Ziqian Geng,Yihua Gu,Jian Kang,Li Wang,Xiaohong Huang,Elizabeth H.

2,Parametric Resonance May Explain Virologic Failure to HIV Treatment Interruptions,"Pilot studies of structured treatment interruptions (STI) in HIV therapy haveshown that patients can maintain low viral loads whilst benefiting from reducedtreatment toxicity. However, a recent STI clinical trial reported a high degreeof virologic failure. Here we present a novel hypothesis that could explainvirologic failure to STI and provides new insights of great clinical relevance.We analyze a classic mathematical model of HIV within-host viral dynamics andfind that nonlinear parametric resonance occurs when STI are added to themodel; resonance is observed as virologic failure. We use the model to simulateclinical trial data and to calculate patient-specific resonant spectra. We gaintwo important insights. Firstly, within an STI trial, we determine thatpatients who begin with similar viral loads can be expected to show extremelydifferent virologic responses as a result of resonance. Thus, highheterogeneity of patient response within a STI clinical trial is to beexpected. Secondly and more importantly, we determine that virologic failure isnot simply due to STI or patient characteristics; rather it is the result of acomplex dynamic interaction between STI and patient viral dynamics. Hence, ouranalyses demonstrate that no universal regimen with periodic interruptions willbe effective for all patients. On the basis of our results, we suggest thatimmunologic and virologic parameters should be used to design patient-specificSTI regimens.",http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0504031v1,"Romulus Breban,Sally Blower"
3,"Efficient nonparametric inference on the effects of stochastic interventions under two-phase sampling, with applications to vaccine efficacy trials","The advent and subsequent widespread availability of preventive vaccines hasaltered the course of public health over the past century. Despite thissuccess, effective vaccines to prevent many high-burden diseases, includingHIV, have been slow to develop. Vaccine development can be aided by theidentification of immune response markers that serve as effective surrogatesfor clinically significant infection or disease endpoints. However, measuringimmune response marker activity is often costly, which has motivated the usageof two-phase sampling for immune response evaluation in clinical trials ofpreventive vaccines. In such trials, the measurement of immunological markersis performed on a subset of trial participants, where enrollment in this secondphase is potentially contingent on the observed study outcome and otherparticipant-level information. We propose nonparametric methodology forefficiently estimating a counterfactual parameter that quantifies the impact ofa given immune response marker on the subsequent probability of infection.Along the way, we fill in theoretical gaps pertaining to the asymptoticbehavior of nonparametric efficient estimators in the context of two-phasesampling, including a multiple robustness property enjoyed by our estimators.Techniques for constructing confidence intervals and hypothesis tests arepresented, and an open source software implementation of the methodology, thetxshift R package, is introduced. We illustrate the proposed techniques usingdata from a recent preventive HIV vaccine efficacy trial.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13771v2,"Nima S. Hejazi,Mark J. van der Laan,Holly E. Janes,Peter B.

4,"DEMO: Dose Exploration, Monitoring, and Optimization Using a Biological Mediator for Clinical Outcomes","Phase 1-2 designs provide a methodological advance over phase 1 designs fordose finding by using both clinical response and toxicity. A phase 1-2 trialstill may fail to select a truly optimal dose. because early response is not aperfect surrogate for long term therapeutic success. To address this problem, ageneralized phase 1-2 design first uses a phase 1-2 design's components toidentify a set of candidate doses, adaptively randomizes patients among thecandidates, and after longer follow up selects a dose to maximize long-termsuccess rate. In this paper, we extend this paradigm by proposing a design thatexploits an early treatment-related, real-valued biological outcome, such aspharmacodynamic activity or an immunological effect, that may act as a mediatorbetween dose and clinical outcomes, including tumor response, toxicity, andsurvival time. We assume multivariate dose-outcome models that include effectsappearing in causal pathways from dose to the clinical outcomes. Bayesian modelselection is used to identify and eliminate biologically inactive doses. At theend of the trial, a therapeutically optimal dose is chosen from the set ofdoses that are acceptably safe, clinically effective, and biologically activeto maximize restricted mean survival time. Results of a simulation study showthat the proposed design may provide substantial improvements over designs thatignore the biological variable.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02120v1,"Cheng-Han Yang,Peter F.

5,Unlocking Historical Clinical Trial Data with ALIGN: A Compositional Large Language Model System for Medical Coding,"The reuse of historical clinical trial data has significant potential toaccelerate medical research and drug development. However, interoperabilitychallenges, particularly with missing medical codes, hinders effective dataintegration across studies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer apromising solution for automated coding without labeled data, currentapproaches face challenges on complex coding tasks. We introduce ALIGN, a novelcompositional LLM-based system for automated, zero-shot medical coding. ALIGNfollows a three-step process: (1) diverse candidate code generation; (2)self-evaluation of codes and (3) confidence scoring and uncertainty estimationenabling human deferral to ensure reliability. We evaluate ALIGN on harmonizingmedication terms into Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) and medical historyterms into Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codesextracted from 22 immunology trials. ALIGN outperformed the LLM baselines,while also providing capabilities for trustworthy deployment. For MedDRAcoding, ALIGN achieved high accuracy across all levels, matching RAG andexcelling at the most specific levels (87-90% for HLGT). For ATC coding, ALIGNdemonstrated superior performance, particularly at lower hierarchy levels (ATCLevel 4), with 72-73% overall accuracy and 86-89% accuracy for commonmedications, outperforming baselines by 7-22%. ALIGN's uncertainty-baseddeferral improved accuracy by 17% to 90% accuracy with 30% deferral, notablyenhancing performance on uncommon medications. ALIGN achieves thiscost-efficiently at \$0.0007 and \$0.02 per code for GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o,reducing barriers to clinical adoption. ALIGN advances automated medical codingfor clinical trial data, contributing to enhanced data interoperability andreusability, positioning it as a promising tool to improve clinical researchand accelerate drug development.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13163v1,"Nabeel Seedat,Caterina Tozzi,Andrea Hita Ardiaca,Mihaela van der Schaar,James Weatherall,Adam Taylor"
6,An immunological autobiography: my year as a COVID-19 vaccine trial participant,"I present here longitudinal evaluation of T and B cell immunity to SARS-CoV2and variants of concern (VOC) from a single subject (me) over an entire yearpost vaccination. After enrolling in the Moderna phase III clinical trial, Icollected my own biological samples pre- and post-immunization in the event ofbeing a recipient of the experimental vaccine. The evidence strongly supportsthe conclusion that I did not receive the placebo. The analysis is admittedlylimited to an n of 1, but the results fit well with data taken from publishedworks and represent one of the more comprehensive longitudinal evaluations ofvaccine-elicited immunity within a single individual yet to be undertaken.Though the data amount to a well-documented anecdote, given its granularity, itis not without its insights and may be of further use in directing futurelongitudinal studies that have actual statistical significance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01282v2,Ross M.

7,What Radio Waves Tell Us about Sleep,"The ability to assess sleep at home, capture sleep stages, and detect theoccurrence of apnea (without on-body sensors) simply by analyzing the radiowaves bouncing off people's bodies while they sleep is quite powerful. Such acapability would allow for longitudinal data collection in patients' homes,informing our understanding of sleep and its interaction with various diseasesand their therapeutic responses, both in clinical trials and routine care. Inthis article, we develop an advanced machine learning algorithm for passivelymonitoring sleep and nocturnal breathing from radio waves reflected off peoplewhile asleep. Validation results in comparison with the gold standard (i.e.,polysomnography) (n=849) demonstrate that the model captures the sleephypnogram (with an accuracy of 81% for 30-second epochs categorized into Wake,Light Sleep, Deep Sleep, or REM), detects sleep apnea (AUROC = 0.88), andmeasures the patient's Apnea-Hypopnea Index (ICC=0.95; 95% CI = [0.93, 0.97]).Notably, the model exhibits equitable performance across race, sex, and age.Moreover, the model uncovers informative interactions between sleep stages anda range of diseases including neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, andimmunological disorders. These findings not only hold promise for clinicalpractice and interventional trials but also underscore the significance ofsleep as a fundamental component in understanding and managing variousdiseases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11739v2,"Hao He,Chao Li,Wolfgang Ganglberger,Kaileigh Gallagher,Rumen Hristov,Michail Ouroutzoglou,Haoqi Sun,Jimeng Sun,Brandon Westover,Dina Katabi"
8,Distinguishing immunological and behavioral effects of vaccination,"The interpretation of vaccine efficacy estimands is subtle, even inrandomized trials designed to quantify immunological effects of vaccination. Inthis article, we introduce terminology to distinguish between different vaccineefficacy estimands and clarify their interpretations. This allows us toexplicitly consider immunological and behavioural effects of vaccination, andestablish that policy-relevant estimands can differ substantially from thosecommonly reported in vaccine trials. We further show that a conventionalvaccine trial allows identification and estimation of different vaccineestimands under plausible conditions, if one additional post-treatment variableis measured. Specifically, we utilize a ``belief variable'' that indicates thetreatment an individual believed they had received. The belief variable issimilar to ``blinding assessment'' variables that are occasionally collected inplacebo-controlled trials in other fields. We illustrate the relations betweenthe different estimands, and their practical relevance, in numerical examplesbased on an influenza vaccine trial.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08335v1,"Mats Stensrud,Daniel Nevo,Uri Obolski"
9,"Panacea: A foundation model for clinical trial search, summarization, design, and recruitment","Clinical trials are fundamental in developing new drugs, medical devices, andtreatments. However, they are often time-consuming and have low success rates.Although there have been initial attempts to create large language models(LLMs) for clinical trial design and patient-trial matching, these modelsremain task-specific and not adaptable to diverse clinical trial tasks. Toaddress this challenge, we propose a clinical trial foundation model namedPanacea, designed to handle multiple tasks, including trial search, trialsummarization, trial design, and patient-trial matching. We also assemble alarge-scale dataset, named TrialAlign, of 793,279 trial documents and 1,113,207trial-related scientific papers, to infuse clinical knowledge into the model bypre-training. We further curate TrialInstruct, which has 200,866 of instructiondata for fine-tuning. These resources enable Panacea to be widely applicablefor a range of clinical trial tasks based on user requirements.  We evaluated Panacea on a new benchmark, named TrialPanorama, which coverseight clinical trial tasks. Our method performed the best on seven of the eighttasks compared to six cutting-edge generic or medicine-specific LLMs.Specifically, Panacea showed great potential to collaborate with human expertsin crafting the design of eligibility criteria, study arms, and outcomemeasures, in multi-round conversations. In addition, Panacea achieved 14.42%improvement in patient-trial matching, 41.78% to 52.02% improvement in trialsearch, and consistently ranked at the top for five aspects of trialsummarization. Our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of Panacea inclinical trials and establishes a comprehensive resource, including trainingdata, model, and benchmark, for developing clinical trial foundation models,paving the path for AI-based clinical trial development.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11007v1,"Jiacheng Lin,Hanwen Xu,Zifeng Wang,Sheng Wang,Jimeng Sun"
10,Assessment of Immune Correlates of Protection via Controlled Vaccine Efficacy and Controlled Risk,"Immune correlates of protection (CoPs) are immunologic biomarkers accepted asa surrogate for an infectious disease clinical endpoint and thus can be usedfor traditional or provisional vaccine approval. To study CoPs in randomized,placebo-controlled trials, correlates of risk (CoRs) are first assessed invaccine recipients. This analysis does not assess causation, as a CoR may failto be a CoP. We propose a causal CoP analysis that estimates the controlledvaccine efficacy curve across biomarker levels $s$, $CVE(s)$, equal to oneminus the ratio of the controlled-risk curve $r_C(s)$ at $s$ and placebo risk,where $r_C(s)$ is causal risk if all participants are assigned vaccine and thebiomarker is set to $s$. The criterion for a useful CoP is wide variability of$CVE(s)$ in $s$. Moreover, estimation of $r_C(s)$ is of interest in itself,especially in studies without a placebo arm. For estimation of $r_C(s)$,measured confounders can be adjusted for by any regression method thataccommodates missing biomarkers, to which we add sensitivity analysis toquantify robustness of CoP evidence to unmeasured confounding. Application totwo harmonized phase 3 trials supports that 50% neutralizing antibody titer hasvalue as a controlled vaccine efficacy CoP for virologically confirmed dengue(VCD): in CYD14 the point estimate (95% confidence interval) for $CVE(s)$accounting for measured confounders and building in conservative margin forunmeasured confounding increases from 29.6% (95% CI 3.5 to 45.9) at titer 1:36to 78.5% (95% CI 67.9 to 86.8) at titer 1:1200; these estimates are 17.4% (95%CI -14.4 to 36.5) and 84.5% (95% CI 79.6 to 89.1) for CYD15.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05734v1,"Peter B.

11,Trial2Vec: Zero-Shot Clinical Trial Document Similarity Search using Self-Supervision,"Clinical trials are essential for drug development but are extremelyexpensive and time-consuming to conduct. It is beneficial to study similarhistorical trials when designing a clinical trial. However, lengthy trialdocuments and lack of labeled data make trial similarity search difficult. Wepropose a zero-shot clinical trial retrieval method, Trial2Vec, which learnsthrough self-supervision without annotating similar clinical trials.Specifically, the meta-structure of trial documents (e.g., title, eligibilitycriteria, target disease) along with clinical knowledge (e.g., UMLS knowledgebase https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html) are leveraged toautomatically generate contrastive samples. Besides, Trial2Vec encodes trialdocuments considering meta-structure thus producing compact embeddingsaggregating multi-aspect information from the whole document. We show that ourmethod yields medically interpretable embeddings by visualization and it gets a15% average improvement over the best baselines on precision/recall for trialretrieval, which is evaluated on our labeled 1600 trial pairs. In addition, weprove the pre-trained embeddings benefit the downstream trial outcomeprediction task over 240k trials.

12,SPOT: Sequential Predictive Modeling of Clinical Trial Outcome with Meta-Learning,"Clinical trials are essential to drug development but time-consuming, costly,and prone to failure. Accurate trial outcome prediction based on historicaltrial data promises better trial investment decisions and more trial success.Existing trial outcome prediction models were not designed to model therelations among similar trials, capture the progression of features and designsof similar trials, or address the skewness of trial data which causes inferiorperformance for less common trials.  To fill the gap and provide accurate trial outcome prediction, we proposeSequential Predictive mOdeling of clinical Trial outcome (SPOT) that firstidentifies trial topics to cluster the multi-sourced trial data into relevanttrial topics. It then generates trial embeddings and organizes them by topicand time to create clinical trial sequences. With the consideration of eachtrial sequence as a task, it uses a meta-learning strategy to achieve a pointwhere the model can rapidly adapt to new tasks with minimal updates. Inparticular, the topic discovery module enables a deeper understanding of theunderlying structure of the data, while sequential learning captures theevolution of trial designs and outcomes. This results in predictions that arenot only more accurate but also more interpretable, taking into account thetemporal patterns and unique characteristics of each trial topic. Wedemonstrate that SPOT wins over the prior methods by a significant margin ontrial outcome benchmark data: with a 21.5\% lift on phase I, an 8.9\% lift onphase II, and a 5.5\% lift on phase III trials in the metric of the area underprecision-recall curve (PR-AUC).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05352v1,"Zifeng Wang,Cao Xiao,Jimeng Sun"
13,Automatically Labeling $200B Life-Saving Datasets: A Large Clinical Trial Outcome Benchmark,"The global cost of drug discovery and development exceeds $200 billionannually. The main results of drug discovery and development are the outcomesof clinical trials, which directly influence the regulatory approval of newdrug candidates and ultimately affect patient outcomes. Despite theirsignificance, large-scale, high-quality clinical trial outcome data are notreadily available to the public. Suppose a large clinical trial outcome datasetis provided; machine learning researchers can potentially develop accurateprediction models using past trials and outcome labels, which could helpprioritize and optimize therapeutic programs, ultimately benefiting patients.This paper introduces Clinical Trial Outcome (CTO) dataset, the largest trialoutcome dataset with around 479K clinical trials, aggregating outcomes frommultiple sources of weakly supervised labels, minimizing the noise fromindividual sources, and eliminating the need for human annotation. Thesesources include large language model (LLM) decisions on trial-relateddocuments, news headline sentiments, stock prices of trial sponsors, triallinkages across phases, and other signals such as patient dropout rates andadverse events.

14,Smooth and probabilistic PARAFAC model with auxiliary covariates,"In immunological and clinical studies, matrix-valued time-series dataclustering is increasingly popular. Researchers are interested in findinglow-dimensional embedding of subjects based on potentially high-dimensionallongitudinal features and investigating relationships between static clinicalcovariates and the embedding. These studies are often challenging due to highdimensionality, as well as the sparse and irregular nature of sample collectionalong the time dimension. We propose a smoothed probabilistic PARAFAC modelwith covariates (SPACO) to tackle these two problems while utilizing auxiliarycovariates of interest. We provide intensive simulations to test differentaspects of SPACO and demonstrate its use on an immunological data set frompatients with SARs-CoV-2 infection.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05184v3,Leying Guan
15,Optimal Allocation of Gold Standard Testing under Constrained Availability: Application to Assessment of HIV Treatment Failure,"The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for monitoring theeffectiveness of HIV treatment in resource-limited settings (RLS) are mostlybased on clinical and immunological markers (e.g., CD4 cell counts). Recentresearch indicates that the guidelines are inadequate and can result in higherror rates. Viral load (VL) is considered the ""gold standard"", yet itswidespread use is limited by cost and infrastructure. In this paper, we proposea diagnostic algorithm that uses information from routinely-collected clinicaland immunological markers to guide a selective use of VL testing for diagnosingHIV treatment failure, under the assumption that VL testing is available onlyat a certain portion of patient visits. Our algorithm identifies the patientsubpopulation, such that the use of limited VL testing on them minimizes apre-defined risk (e.g., misdiagnosis error rate). Diagnostic properties of ourproposal algorithm are assessed by simulations. For illustration, data from theMiriam Hospital Immunology Clinic (RI, USA) are analyzed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00692v1,"Tao Liu,Joseph W. Hogan,Lisa Wang,Shangxuan Zhang,Rami Kantor"
16,Exploring the Generalization of Cancer Clinical Trial Eligibility Classifiers Across Diseases,"Clinical trials are pivotal in medical research, and NLP can enhance theirsuccess, with application in recruitment. This study aims to evaluate thegeneralizability of eligibility classification across a broad spectrum ofclinical trials. Starting with phase 3 cancer trials, annotated with seveneligibility exclusions, then to determine how well models can generalize tonon-cancer and non-phase 3 trials. To assess this, we have compiled eligibilitycriteria data for five types of trials: (1) additional phase 3 cancer trials,(2) phase 1 and 2 cancer trials, (3) heart disease trials, (4) type 2 diabetestrials, and (5) observational trials for any disease, comprising 2,490annotated eligibility criteria across seven exclusion types. Our results showthat models trained on the extensive cancer dataset can effectively handlecriteria commonly found in non-cancer trials, such as autoimmune diseases.However, they struggle with criteria disproportionately prevalent in cancertrials, like prior malignancy. We also experiment with few-shot learning,demonstrating that a limited number of disease-specific examples can partiallyovercome this performance gap. We are releasing this new dataset of annotatedeligibility statements to promote the development of cross-diseasegeneralization in clinical trial classification.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17135v1,"Yumeng Yang,Ashley Gilliam,Ethan B Ludmir,Kirk Roberts"
17,TrialSynth: Generation of Synthetic Sequential Clinical Trial Data,"Analyzing data from past clinical trials is part of the ongoing effort tooptimize the design, implementation, and execution of new clinical trials andmore efficiently bring life-saving interventions to market. While there havebeen recent advances in the generation of static context synthetic clinicaltrial data, due to both limited patient availability and constraints imposed bypatient privacy needs, the generation of fine-grained synthetic time-sequentialclinical trial data has been challenging. Given that patient trajectories overan entire clinical trial are of high importance for optimizing trial design andefforts to prevent harmful adverse events, there is a significant need for thegeneration of high-fidelity time-sequence clinical trial data. Here weintroduce TrialSynth, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) designed to address thespecific challenges of generating synthetic time-sequence clinical trial data.Distinct from related clinical data VAE methods, the core of our methodleverages Hawkes Processes (HP), which are particularly well-suited formodeling event-type and time gap prediction needed to capture the structure ofsequential clinical trial data. Our experiments demonstrate that TrialSynthsurpasses the performance of other comparable methods that can generatesequential clinical trial data at varying levels of fidelity / privacytradeoff, enabling the generation of highly accurate event sequences acrossmultiple real-world sequential event datasets with small patient sourcepopulations. Notably, our empirical findings highlight that TrialSynth not onlyoutperforms existing clinical sequence-generating methods but also producesdata with superior utility while empirically preserving patient privacy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07089v2,"Chufan Gao,Mandis Beigi,Afrah Shafquat,Jacob Aptekar,Jimeng Sun"

Despite the significant human and financial costs of bringing a drug tomarket, less than 20% of drugs in testing will make it from the first phase tofinal approval.
